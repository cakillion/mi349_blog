            <h3>Top Threats in IT Today</h3>
            <address class="author">Christian Killion</address>

            <p class="para">In the digital era, many aspects of life are improved, and businesses can flourish. However, with these positive aspects comes negative aspects as well. There are many threats to IT in todays day an age, lets take a look at some of the most prevalent and devastating cyber-attacks. The top threat occurring is ransomware. This threat entrails having your data encrypted and the only way to get the decrypt key is to pay up to the attackers. According to Nick Kwiatkowski, who taught MI 361 this past spring semester at Michigan State, the groups that utilize ransomware set up help desks to walk the people they attacked through steps to decrypt the data after paying the ransom. Another threat can be social engineering, which is as simple as learning about a business and the people that communicate with each other, then creating a fake email that is similar to what the business uses. Finally, all they do is send out emails trying to get employees to click bad links or disclose information that they are not privy to. Finally, DDos attacks are a big threat to web-based applications. DDos, or distributed denial of service attacks, entails overloading a website with requests and packets that it slows or crashes the site. Obviously, these are some major threats in IT and you should always make sure to be on the lookout for attacks like these.</p>

            <h4>Dangers of AI</h4>
            <address class="author">Christian Killion</address>
            <time datetime="2001-02-17" title="February 17, 2001">February 17, 2023</time>
            <p class="para">I was riding around my hometown in my old car the other day when I started thinking about all the dangers that could come with the development and improvements in artificial Intelligence. They might not be as serious as some may come to believe, I highly doubt AI will take over or end the world because the people creating and implementing these AIs have probably seen enough science fiction movies to know how it could be a bad idea in some situations. However, there are still some negative aspects that could come form it. One that comes to mine is an over dependency on these Ais. Sure, it makes finding information like how many Daytona 500s Dale Earnhardt Sr. won easier, but if people begin to think these platforms cant be wrong and start believing in everything the computer generates, we could fall into misinformation / disinformation situations. Furthermore, With the development of AI in certain scenarios, it takes away the need for a human worker. Therefore, it is possible that AI could replace humans in some jobs and create a spike in unemployment rates. While AI can definitely be helpful and boost productivity in some ways, there is still negative aspects that arise with AI.</p>
